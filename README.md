Highly motivated Quality Assurance Engineer with 5+ years of experience. Concerned about delivering fluent communication and speak sincerely and confidently with the Software Delivery Team, the most important thing is generating value for the business preventing production issues, and with the best value quality for the product and projects. Currently, in my position, I’m responsible for initially identifying and defining the required tests monitoring the test coverage, and evaluating the overall quality experienced when testing the target test items. Also, specifying the required test data and evaluating the outcome of the testing conducted in each test cycle. So, one of the major problems I have found in this profession has been a requirement definition or criteria acceptance, delayed with the delivery, environment configuration, re-schedule. So, the team is trying to organize the priorities, organize daily, or at least one videoconference per week with the stakeholders. Afterward, a weekly agreement is generated to meet the priorities. Fluent communication is crucial like speak sincerely and confidently in this kind of problem, the most important thing is generating value for the business preventing production issues.
